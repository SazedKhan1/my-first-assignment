                    flooding in Bangladesh. In Sylhet overflowing rivers have flooded almost every area in the seven
                    upazilas.According to the Sylhet Water Development Board (WDB), river water has never risen so much
                    since 2008. This is the biggest flood in the last 3 decades and WDB officials fear the flood
                    situation could worsen further if the rains continue upstream.
